# Fixed Animation Issue in ConfigPage.vue

The animation issue in the configuration page was fixed by implementing several key changes:

1. **Consistent Animation System**
   - Added `v-if="!isLoading"` to ensure elements are properly unmounted and remounted
   - Used direct animation styles instead of conflicting transitions
   - Added proper delay sequence for card animations

2. **Key Technical Fixes**
   - Removed competing CSS transitions that interfered with animations
   - Used `requestAnimationFrame` for proper timing of animation triggers
   - Implemented inline animation styles with Vue binding
   - Added `!important` to animation keyframes to override any conflicts

3. **Animation Implementation**
   - Each config section now animates independently with proper timing
   - Error messages fade in smoothly
   - Loading spinner has proper animation with automatic fade out

The changes ensure consistent animations across both Status and Config pages, maintaining the "Layered Depth & Smooth Interaction" design approach throughout the application.
